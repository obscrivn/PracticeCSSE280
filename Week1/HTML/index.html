<h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

<p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
    <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
    everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
  
    Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
    We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
    learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

<h2>Background</h2>
Learn enough is an outgrowth of the <a href="href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>. 
This page is part of the sample site for <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough</em></a>, 
which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong><strong>yper</strong><strong>Text</strong> 
<strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage,
the universal language of the World Wide Web.

<h2>Founders</h2>
<p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
    Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of <em>technical
    sophistication</em> taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
    <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.
